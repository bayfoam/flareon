# Flareon
A lightweight web application library built on sockets.

## Specs
On my Windows PC, it can handle up to 20,000 requests/second.
It can probably handle much larger requests if run on Linux with better CPU and multiple cores

## Todo

- Handle URI
- Add Cookie System
- ## Advanced Features to be implemented
    - Template Engine (make my own or use existing one)
    - Build Blueprints
